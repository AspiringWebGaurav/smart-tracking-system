# AI Assistant Popup Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The AI assistant popup was showing correctly in development but not recurring properly in production (Vercel deployment). The issue was:

1. **localStorage Persistence Issue**: Popup session state was being saved to localStorage, causing stale state in production
2. **Hydration Mismatch**: SSR/client-side state differences between dev and production
3. **Timer Logic Issues**: Recurring popup timer wasn't working consistently across environments

## Root Cause
- In production, `popupSessionState` was persisted to localStorage
- On page reload, the saved state had `hasShownInitialPopup: true` which prevented recurring popups
- Hydration differences between server and client caused inconsistent behavior

## Solution Implemented

### Key Changes in `components/ai-assistant/AIAssistant.tsx`:

1. **Added Client-Side Hydration Check**:
   ```typescript
   const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);
   
   useEffect(() => {
     setIsClient(true);
   }, []);
   ```

2. **Fixed localStorage Logic**:
   - Removed localStorage persistence of popup session state
   - Only persist user preferences (hasOpenedAI, hasClosedBefore)
   - Reset popup session state on each page load

3. **Improved Recurring Timer Logic**:
   - Better condition checking with `isClient` guard
   - Cleaner timer management
   - Added debug console logs

4. **Session-Based Approach**:
   - Each session resets popup behavior
   - No stale localStorage state affecting behavior
   - Consistent between development and production

### Expected Behavior After Fix:

1. **Initial Load**: 4-second delay ‚Üí popup appears
2. **Recurring**: Every 10 seconds ‚Üí same popup appears
3. **User Interaction**: Click AI bubble ‚Üí Flash popup ‚Üí Main interface
4. **State Reset**: Each page load resets popup behavior

## Files Modified:
- `components/ai-assistant/AIAssistant.tsx` - Main fix implementation
- `test-popup-behavior.md` - Test plan documentation
- `POPUP_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Testing Plan:
1. Build and deploy to Vercel
2. Clear browser storage
3. Test popup timing and recurring behavior
4. Verify consistency between dev and production

## Deployment Status:
- ‚úÖ Code changes implemented
- üîÑ Building for production
- ‚è≥ Ready for Vercel deployment
- ‚è≥ Production testing pending
