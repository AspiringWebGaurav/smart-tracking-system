// Process your training documents
const processedDoc = await DocumentProcessor.processDocument(
  'C:/Users/GAURAV/Desktop/train-data/README.md',
  'portfolio'
);
```

#### 3. Vector Storage (`lib/vector-store.ts`)
```typescript
// Search for relevant context
const results = await VectorStore.enhancedSearch(
  "Tell me about Gaurav's experience",
  5
);
```

#### 4. Context Retrieval (`lib/context-retrieval.ts`)
```typescript
// Generate enhanced prompts
const prompt = await SystemPromptGenerator.generateEnhancedPrompt(
  userQuery
);
```
